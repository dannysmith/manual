# Danny: The Haynes Manual

Hey. 👋  I'm Danny. Here's what my Twitter bio says about me:

> **Software Engineer** & **Teacher**. Passionate about technology education and helping people be happy at work. I also play blues music.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannysmith), [Medium](https://medium.com/@dannysmith), [GitHub](https://github.com/dannysmith) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/dannysmith) as `@dannysmith`, and on the web at [danny.is](https://danny.is). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyasmith), though I rarely use it.

#### ⚠️ This isn't really a manual...

Intruction manuals provide definate instructions on how you should use something. You pretty much have to follow them. Working together is different: it's a *n*-way thing. So this isn't really an instruction manual at all, it's just a load of information about how I *like* to work. It outlines my preferences and peculiarities in the hope that by knowing them up-front, we can find a way to do **amazing things** together.

**I will do my best to adjust my personality to help with this.**

Nothing in here is set in stone. Nothing is an isntrction, or even a recommendation. It's just a **heads-up**.

Thanks to Dan Barrett for [the idea](https://medium.com/@dasbarrett/a-user-manual-for-dan-d0a285874f72) (he links to a bunch more).

## When I Work Best

I'm a night owl by nature. 🦉

I've tried many times to become a morning person, but after ten years of failed attempts (including 6-months running 3 miles at 6am *every day*), I've realised that it just makes me grumpy and ruins my ability to do good work.

While the realities of life prevent me working my ideal hours (`13:00-16:00` & `19:00-02:00`), I'm rarely at my best first thing in the morning. If you need me at my best, don't book a meeting for 9am if at all possible.

While I'm a firm believer in [Sustainable Pace](http://www.sustainablepace.net/what-is-sustainable-pace), you'll sometimes see me working late at night. This will almost always be because I want to. On no account should abybody feel any *obligation* to follow my lead, or that doing so will earn brownie points or make them some sort of hero.

While we're on the subject of **work-life balance**, I tend to mix the two together. Experience says that, for me, seperating them is detrimental to both. Thins means that you will sometimes find me doing "life" things at work, and "work" things at home. That said, if a strict seperation of the two works for you, I **totally respect that**, and expect everyone else to.


## My Oddities and Flaws

> **🕵️‍♀️ HOLMES**: I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street which would suit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?
> 
> **👨🏻‍🔧 WATSON**: I always smoke *Ship's* myself,
> 
> **🕵️‍♀️ HOLMES**: That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?
> 
> **👨🏻‍🔧 WATSON**: By no means.
> 
> **🕵️‍♀️ HOLMES**: Let me see–what are my other shortcomings? I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What have you to confess now? **It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to ~~live~~ work together**.

According to Myers-Briggs, I'm an **ENTJ**. I'd highly reccomend [reading my profile](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) – it's scarily accurate. I'd also love you to send me yours.

### Things I need

* **Movement**. My worst nightmare is a week of 8-hour days sat silently at a laptop. I need to move and wave my arms about, and I **need to talk**. This means I really like pairing. I love walking meetings, and walk about a lot when I'm thinking - I'm sorry if this is distracting.
* **Variety**. While I can be very happy doing a single type of work (say coding) for quite a long time, the longer I do it the more I crave something different once it's done. The exception to this is work that is inherantly varied, like coaching and project-management.
* **An [oppo](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oppo&defid=219610)**. I work fine alone, but am happer when I've got a partner(s) in crime. I need someone to bounce ideas off and to challenge me.
* **Transparency**. I need to have open conversations and the more business context I have, the more engaged I'll be.
* **Autonomy**. I really need to feel trusted, and to be given autonomy.

### Things I love

* **Teaching**. I *love* helping people **really understand** complex things - this is what makes me tick.
* Seeing people get better *as people*. This is not the same as "seeing people learn new things" - there's far more to it.
* Designing **systems**. And also solving systems-related problems. I often find systems that involve people more interesting than systems that just involve tech.
* Building tools that **make people's lives easier**. Because programmers are people, this means I really enjoy building tools and abstractions to make programmers lives easier, too.
* **Learning**. Pretty much anything , really.
* Clean, well-structured code that's east to read and reason about.
* Clean, well-designed business systems that are easy to use and reason about.
* Whiteboards, post-it notes and [things on walls](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/information-radiators/) (this has become a running joke everywhere I've worked).

### Things I find hard

* **Asking for help**. Particularly when I feel like I *shouldn't need help* with a thing. I'm trying to get better at this.
* **Shutting up**. I talk a lot, and most people I know see this as a good thing. That said, I don't always know when to shut up. I'm working on this, too.
* **Making hard decisions without a sounding board**. Even if I've already reached a decision, I'm not great at comitting to it without first running it by someone else as a sort of sanity check. It's why you'll often hear me ask "I think I should do XX. Does that sound sensible or insane?".
* **Being consistant for long periods**. I tend to have spurts of energy. At a macro level, these spurts often last for three months or so. Establishing routines and processes help with this, but I don't think I'll ever be happy doing the same morning routine and ploughing through the same kind of work for years at a time. This can also manifest at a micro level, and have an impact on my work and those around me. If you feel like I'm being inconsistant in my behaviour and it's nagatively impacting you, **please tell me** and I'll establish a routine to fix it. 

> **📝 Aside**: I used to be really bad at being on time for things. I'm not anymore, but I mention it here because if I am late for something, I'll feel *really* shit about if all day.


## On Arguing / Debating

Here's a paragraph from my [ENTJ profile](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality):

> ENTJ friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the ENTJ personality type are very smart and highly critical, and they won't back down if they are put on the defensive – in fact, **there’s no better way to earn their respect**.

> It’s not easy to stand up to a personality as big and blustery as ENTJ's, and they too often find that others crumple under the force they apply when they really start to enjoy themselves.

This describes me fairly accurateley. I *really enjoy arguing* – it helps to order my thoughts and spark new ideas. Key points...

* You **will not** hurt my feelings by arguing with me – quite the opposite!
* I have a lot of ideas, and most of them are shit. Please be blunt and shoot them down with no regard for my feelings – it's the only way I'll have any better ones.
* If I argue against your idea then I am arguing against your idea, **not against you**!
* I reverse my decisions **very** quickly when presented with a compelling counter-argument.
* If it's feels like I'm having a dig at you, I honestly don't mean it that way.
* I will probably talk over you. **Please talk over me**, and if that's not how you roll then then tell me bluntly to shut up – providing you feel comfortable doing so.
* I'm **acutely** aware that not everyone else is like this, and I can make people feel uncomfortable. If the above sounds like hell to you, please tell me (see *Feedback* below). I'll moderate my behaviour.

Despite all this, I subscribe to the "strong opinions, loosely held" school of thought, and like to [disagree and commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit) if a dabate has run out of new logical arguments.

## Managing my Work

I've been using [GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) for fourteen years. I even had a [Hipster PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA) back in the day.

If you ask me to do something, it will get added to my [list](https://culturedcode.com/things/). If it's urgent, has a deadline or is blocking your work then please make that **really clear** to me. It will save you nagging me later.

## Smoking 🚬

I smoke fairly heavily. This means that I'll dissapear from my desk regularly. If I'm stumped by a problem I use the time away from my laptop to think about it. Otherwise, I tend to catch up on Slack and GitHub notifications while I'm smoking.

If we're pairing on something and you feel like I'm timing my smoke breaks badly, just say so.

## Meetings & Interruptions

If something is in my calendar, I **will always turn up for it**. With that in mind, please don't invite me to meetings "just so I'm aware it's happening" – email or Slack me instead. Equally, if you want my time for any reason, please feel free to put something in my calendar (ideally with at least 24 hours notice). If I accept, **it's a date**. If you know what you want to talk about, tell me in advance so I can prepare my brain and dig out any relevant stuff. I like to batch meetings together if I can, and try to keep one day a week meeting-free.

This shouldn't put you off **coming over and talking to me**. I'm always open to that.

If I'm in the office I'm **always interruptable**, even if I have my headphones on. If I need to really focus I'll either go home or leave the office, so if you see me working in a coffee shop, please don't interrupt me.

## Communications

Although I check my emails regularly, I only deal with them in batches. I'll usually reply to important email within 24 hours, but will often "batch process" the rest once a week. I will *eventually* respond to all emails that need one.

I'm not a fan of **Reply to All** and usually just reply to the sender unless I think my response will be valueble to everyone. Because of this, it can sometimes look like I'm ignoring other people's emails.

I prefer Slack as my main communication channel, and will see `@mentions` within half an hour or so unless I'm in Lockdown™ and have DND switched on (this is pretty rare if I'm in the office).

I'll set my slack status to 🔒 if I'm in Lockdown™. This means I'm 100% focussed on what I'm doing and am basically off-comms. I'll always announce this on slack.

If you need something urgently, send me a Slack DM. I will always be notified of these. Or come and talk to me in person if we're both in the same place.

I'm happy for anyone to share my personal email address and mobile number (inside or outside the company), though I don't usually answer my phone to unknown numbers. That said, I will respond to a **Voicemail**, **text** or **WhatsApp** message explaining who the caller is. If you're sharing my number with someone else, please tell them this.

## Feedback

I **really value feedback**, even if sometimes it donesn't seem like it. Some points to bear in mind:

* If we're mid-debate, immediate feedback will never elicit an emotional response. You can be as rude and abrupt as you like (see above).
* If your feedback is not heat-of-the-moment my initial response will be emotional, however you deliver it. **I will probably be defensive**. I'm working on getting better at this.
* I value considered feedback over heat-of-the-moment feedback. The latter is often just "good conversation" to me, no matter how harsh.
* I prefer you to give feedback in whatever way feels best to you: be that in-person, by email or by carrier pigeon.
* If I feel you lack some context that I have, I'll be **really keen** to provide that context and see if your feedback remains the same.
* I value **all** feedback, and **want to hear it**.

📝 If you feel more comfortable giving anonymous feedback, [you can do so here](http://c.danny.is/qPXI).

## More on Me

I live in a lovely house in Islington with some friends. I buy a lot of books on business and self-improvement but read at a slower rate than I buy so if you want to borrow a book, I have quite a few.

I used to sing a lot of blues music. You can see some [here](https://danny.is/singing) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/dannysmithmusic/videos/). If you're into blues and fancy a jam, I'm game 🎶.

I've spent the last seven years working with some truly exceptional people teaching instructors in the [Royal Air Force Air Cadets](https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/) how to teach – predominantly Skill at Arms. I'm the one in the middle:
